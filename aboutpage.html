				<p>
				My name is Sayed Ahmed; I am one of ten kids. I was born in a small village in Bangladesh. My family and I immigrated to the US in 2005. Since I was in kindergarten to now I have been drawing and I have always loved drawing.  I have this passion for art and there is this inner feeling that wants to pursue it and can not live without it.
				<br><br>
				</p>

				<p>I am currently attending college working on an associate’s degree in graphic design. I am studying graphic design because I love the use of technology and art.  I have been playing with digital art since I was in kindergarten from drawing in Microsoft paint, working on my editing skills in pixlr.com, to eventually using Photoshop, then learning illustrator, and now Premiere Pro and InDesign.
				<br><br>
				</p>

				<p>In the future, I hope to transfer to a university, have an internship in a design company, and eventually work for a studio. One thing I am certain of is I’ll still be creating art and finding ways to express myself in whatever way I can.</p>
